**While Loops**

###**Question 1**###

```
While loops let the computer execute a set of instructions while a condition is true.
```

###**Question 2**###

```
def print_prime_factors(number):
  # Start with two, which is the first prime
  factor = 2
  # Keep going until the factor is larger than the number
  while factor <= number:
    # Check if factor is a divisor of number
    if number % factor == 0:
      # If it is, print it and divide the original number
      print(factor)
      number = number / factor
    else:
      # If it's not, increment the factor by one
      factor += 1
  return "Done"

print_prime_factors(100)
# Should print 2,2,5,5
# DO NOT DELETE THIS COMMENT
```

###**Question 3**###

```
def is_power_of_two(n):
  # Check if the number can be divided by two without a remainder
  while n != 0 and n % 2 == 0:
    n = n / 2
  # If after dividing by two the number is 1, it's a power of two
  if n == 1:
    return True
  return False
  

print(is_power_of_two(0)) # Should be False
print(is_power_of_two(1)) # Should be True
print(is_power_of_two(8)) # Should be True
print(is_power_of_two(9)) # Should be False
```

###**Question 4**###

```
def sum_divisors(n):
  sum = 0
  i = 1
  while i < n:
    if n%i == 0:
      sum += i
    i += 1
  # Return the sum of all divisors of n, not including n
  return sum

print(sum_divisors(0))
# 0
print(sum_divisors(3)) # Should sum of 1
# 1
print(sum_divisors(36)) # Should sum of 1+2+3+4+6+9+12+18
# 55
print(sum_divisors(102)) # Should be sum of 2+3+6+17+34+51
# 114

```

###**Question 5**###

```
def multiplication_table(number):
	# Initialize the starting point of the multiplication table
	multiplier = 1
	# Only want to loop through 5
	while multiplier <= 5:
		result =  multiplier*number
		multiplier + 1
		# What is the additional condition to exit out of the loop?
		if result > 25 :
			break
		print(str(number) + "x" + str(multiplier) + "=" + str(result))
		# Increment the variable for the loop
		multiplier += 1

multiplication_table(3) 
# Should print: 3x1=3 3x2=6 3x3=9 3x4=12 3x5=15

multiplication_table(5) 
# Should print: 5x1=5 5x2=10 5x3=15 5x4=20 5x5=25

multiplication_table(8)	
# Should print: 8x1=8 8x2=16 8x3=24
```
